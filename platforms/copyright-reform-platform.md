# Creative Commons Network: Copyright reform platform

## Background
Creative Commons has a broad [vision](https://creativecommons.org/about/mission-and-vision/) that imagines a world that is substantially different from the current situation:
>Our vision is nothing less than realizing the full potential of the Internet — universal access to research and education, full participation in culture — to drive a new era of development, growth, and productivity.

CC’s organisational [mission](https://creativecommons.org/about/mission-and-vision/) is focused on providing tools for sharing: 
>Creative Commons develops, supports, and stewards legal and technical infrastructure that maximizes digital creativity, sharing, and innovation.

It is evident that the activities covered by the mission statement can only be a partial contribution to realizing the overarching vision of the organisation. But Creative Commons’ [updated strategy](https://creativecommons.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CC-Strategy-2016-2020-1.pdf) (January 2016) identifies advocacy as one of the three main pillars of its work over the next five years. CC’s organisational strategy explicitly ties advocacy efforts to the Creative Commons Global Network: 
>Advocacy is about CC’s vital role in advocacy and policymaking. Creative Commons has a powerful and respected voice which can be used to advocate for positive reforms. We are frequently called upon to lend our voice to important open policy debates, and to explain the impacts for the public good of particular policies, while identifying areas where new or existing policy impacts the ability of users to apply or rely upon CC licenses. However, the fight for copyright reform is a global one, and will only be won if we activate the power of many interconnected global communities. CC does not have the capacity or expertise to manage copyright reform campaigns globally, but the CC affiliate network can, if properly supported and engaged. CC will put collaboration at the centre of our approach, as we have been successful at supporting and collaborating with connected communities that advocate for policies that strengthen the commons, like the Open Policy Network and Communia.

Creative Commons is committed to copyright policy advocacy, and it makes sense that advocacy efforts rely on collaboration with the members of the Creative Commons Global Network. 

This means that the Creative Commons Global Network should include a platform for copyright reform. CC affiliates have been vocal in their desire to engage within copyright policy discussions to influence law reform in the area. The [Creative Commons copyright reform statement](https://creativecommons.org/2013/10/16/supporting-copyright-reform/) was initiated by affiliate network members and adopted by Creative Commons in 2013 at the Global summit in Buenos Aires. And several individuals and organisations are already actively involved in copyright reform activities. 

## Rationale
There are three main reasons why copyright reform is an issue that Creative Commons should focus on: 
1. Copyright provides the legal basis for the tools offered by Creative Commons, and changes to copyright can affect how these tools function, 
2. Creative Commons is perceived to be a stakeholder in discussions about copyright policy (both by our friends as well as our enemies), and 
3. Copyright is the most important regulative framework that shapes the digital commons, and thus directly influences the ability to realize our vision.
