# Guide to Establishing a Chapter

Chapters serve as the central coordinator of the work of the individuals and institutions participating within a country in support of the Creative Commons Global Network ("CCGN"). This guide will provide instructions on how to create a chapter if one does not already exist, and applies whether you are an affiliate with an Affiliate Agreement or Memorandum of Understanding with Creative Commons (an “affiliate”), there is an affiliate in your country but you are not involved or associated with it directly as an employee, volunteer or other, or you are someone new to the CCGN and a chapter or affiliate doesn’t exist in your country. 

* If a chapter has already been formed, then this guide **_is not_** for you. You should [contact the chapter](http://network.creativecommons.org) to learn more about how to participate. Note that chapters must be inclusive. If you experience any difficulties with your request to participate in the chapter of your choice, contact the Network Manager.

* If a chapter has not already been formed, then this guide **_is_** for you. 

    * If you are a current CC Affiliate, or in the case of an affiliate institution are acting on its behalf, then you may (but are not required) to organize the first chapter meeting.

    * If an affiliate exists but you are not working with it already as an employee, volunteer or other, contact the Network Manager (simeon@creativecommons.org) .

## Step 1: Determine Status of CC Activities in Your Country; Join the CCGN

Check the [Network website](network.creativecommons.org) to determine whether a chapter or affiliate(s) already exists in your country. If not, then determine whether there’s already a group of people working or organizing a chapter in the country where you wish to participate or are based. You may find more information into the [Chapter Guidelines document](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/chapters-guidelines.md). And if you need any guidance or help, just let the Network Manager know (simeon@creativecommons.org). 

Although it is not required to participate, to form a Chapter at least some of you should be a member of the Creative Commons Global Network. Follow [these instructions](network.creativecommons.org) to become a Member of the CCGN. 

## Step 2: Organize the first Chapter Meeting

* Remember the first Chapter meeting is neither a "members" meeting or an affiliate meeting, but a chapter meeting. This means that if you are coordinating the organization of the first meeting, you should invite and include everyone interested, conduct outreach with sufficient notice to ensure everyone interested is aware of the meeting, and conduct the meeting as openly and visibly as you can. 

* **Notify the Network Manager of your intention to coordinate the organization of the first meeting**. Send us an email to [network-support@creativecommons.org](mailto:network-support@creativecommons.org). This allows us to assist you, and inform you of others who have expressed interest in organizing the first chapter meeting or participating. Use social media to make this meeting as public and welcoming new people to join the conversation. If you need any help with outreach strategies, how to structure or arrange logistics for the meeting or help communicating the fact you are hosting the meeting, let the Network Manager know. 

* **It is not required that this meeting be in-person**. It will always be a challenge to connect with all volunteers within a country; however, we strongly encourage you to provide ways for those who cannot be present in-person to participate remotely, absent some logistical difficulties. Again, notify the Network Manager if you need assistance.

* **Be familiar with the documentation**. Be sure you are familiar with the [CCGN Strategy](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/GlobalNetworkStrategy-Final.md), the [Charter](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Global_Network_Membership_Charter.md) (including the Code of Conduct and the policies contained and referenced therein) and, especially, the [Chapter Standards and Guidelines](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/chapters-guidelines.md). Encourage everyone participating in the first meeting to have reviewed all of those documents in advance. 

* **Communicate** to those participating in the initial meeting that:
	* Only Individual Members of the CCGN may serve as a Representative or Chapter Lead, though all Country Participants (members and non-members alike) may participate in their selection. 
	* Members and non members are only allowed to participate in a single chapter for purposes of selecting a Representative and Chapter.

* See the [Chapter Standards and Guidelines](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/chapters-guidelines.md) for more information.

## Step 3: Convene the First Meeting

* **Purpose**. The purpose of the first meeting is to bring together different voices, faces and ideas regarding how to work together as a chapter. You are free of organize the meeting as you will provided the meeting adhere to [some minimum criteria](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/chapters-guidelines.md). 

* At a minimum, two things need to happen during the first meeting:

1. Chapter will elect a member as a **Representative** [link to CCGN Rep and Public Lead Role descriptions] at the Global Network Council. Only CCGN Individual Members can be elected as such.

2. Chapter will select a **Chapter Lead** [link to CCGN Rep and Public Lead Role descriptions] to be the main point of contact of the Chapter. Again, only CCGN Individual Members can be elected as such.

* Prepare and publish a clear agenda in advance, designate a person to be the note-taker, and invite as many people as you can!

* In advance of the organizing meeting, for the upcoming meeting -or other ways to participate such as mailing lists, Slack channels or others- it seems a good idea start discussion concrete projects to work together at the local level.

**TEMPLATE AGENDA FOR THE FIRST CHAPTER MEETING**

* Review agenda
* Introductions, roll call (identify and document who is present, what their interests are, etc.)
* Designate a note taker (notes should be sent to the Network Manager for publication [on the CCGN website](https://network.creativecommons.org) promptly following the meeting)
* Review highlights of the Strategy, Charter, Chapter Guidelines, and Codes of Conduct
* Election of Representative (explain responsibilities)
* Election of Chapter Lead (explain responsibilities)
* Discuss work of the Chapter
* Chapter processes and coordination
* How to communicate (Slack? email list? etc.)
* Website coordination (who is in charge, etc.)

```

## Step 4: After the Meeting

* Send the minutes of the meeting to the Network Manager using the template. These will be publicly posted. [You can use this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iu-6wzAbeWmqTr7CRY59zHbLHTsbvKVx_dy2A-OcWaU/edit?usp=sharing) we have prepared to make it simple. If you are not comfortable writing this in English, you can write it in your own language. Just let us know that situation first. 

* Identify the Chapter Lead and Representative.

* Tell us about your meeting. The information about the meeting is important not just to know who will be the point of contact of the chapter from now on, but also to know more about your first meeting, your plans and your people! The Network Manager will be in contact with you from the early stages of the process to facilitate the process.

* We will include your new chapter in the list of Creative Commons chapters part of the Global Network.
