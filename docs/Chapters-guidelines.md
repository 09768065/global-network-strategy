# Chapter Guidelines

These guidelines are designed to help local Chapters organize themselves; they are not mandatory rules; provided however, that Chapters may not establish policies that are in conflict with the Charter, and Chapters must comply with [CC policies](https://creativecommons.org/policies), as described below. Chapters can, and often will, establish additional rules, guidelines and principles beyond those suggested here. This document also aims to provide clarification about the relationship between Chapters, the Creative Commons Global Network ("CCGN"), and individual CCGN Members and other contributors. 

## About the Chapters

A Chapter is constituted by all CCGN Members (Individual and Institutional Members) and other contributing people and organizations working in a particular country. Local chapters are entitled to organize themselves in the way in which they see fit, consistent [with the Global Network Charter](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/docs/Global_Network_Membership_Charter.md) and [CC policies](https://creativecommons.org/policies). Contributors who are not CCGN Members may also participate in Chapters. 

Chapters must follow these guidelines:

* **(1) Chapters must be open**. Chapter membership must be open to all Network Members that are working in that country, as well as others who wish to participate in the Chapter. A Member or other participant may only be affiliated with one CC Chapter at a time, but this does not preclude them from contributing in other countries; nor does this require a Member or other participant working within a country to participate in a Chapter, though they must still abide by [CC policies](https://creativecommons.org/policies) and coordinate with their local Chapter before speaking or acting on behalf of CC or the Chapter.

* **(2) Members of each Chapter will elect a Global Network Council representative**. Each CC Chapter will elect one representative to the Global Network Council. Representatives are elected for a period, likely 1 or 2 years, to be determined at a later date by the GNC. Only Members can be elected as GNC representative, though non members and other participants in the Chapter may vote in the election for the representative. 

* **(3) Chapters will choose a Chapter Lead or Coordinator**. Each CC Chapter will select an individual to be responsible for coordinating and communicating on behalf of CC Chapter activities. This person will serve as a the main point of contact for CC when forwarding or responding to inquiries regarding activities in that country. This is analogous to the "public lead" in the previous Creative Commons Affiliates model, but each Chapter may select their own appropriate title for the position. This person may also be the Representative to the Global Network Council but is not required to be. Only Members may be selected as the Chapter Lead or Coordinator, though non members participating in a Chapter may participate in the selection process. 

* **(4) Chapters will work by consensus**. This does not mean that all Members must make every decision together, or that structures of authority and decision-making cannot be established using a consensus model; what it does require is that teams work openly, and voices must be allowed to be heard and considered before making a final decision. In situations of conflict, Chapters can refer the matter to the Global Network Council’s Dispute Resolution Committee.

## Responsibilities of local Chapters to the Global Network

The main responsibilities of the CC Chapter are to 

* Run activities and provide support to local projects.
* Serve as a contact and information point for questions about CC.
* Represent the CCGN in interactions with governments and organisations.
* Maintain and update a country-specific website on cc.org. 
* Establish country consensus on positions related to the CCGN.
* Report on accomplishments and otherwise keep informed the Global Network Council about the Chapter’s activities.
* Elect a representative for the Global Network Council and ensure that person actively fulfills those responsibilities.
* Ensure country positions align with global positions of platforms where they exist, and where they do not exist ensure that positions taken by the Chapter and its Members and other participants align with CC’s mission and overall objectives. This anticipates coordination with CC and the CCGN through the Chapter’s representation when positions are uncertain, or when new positions may reasonably be considered controversial.

## Membership for local chapters

Local CC Chapters are comprised of Members of the CCGN, who are working towards the Creative Commons mission and vision in that country. The Chapter may also include other contributors who are not Members. Local chapters are given flexibility to establish rules about joining and participating in the work of the Chapter. However, these rules **must not be used** to exclude individuals or organizations who have a demonstrated commitment to contribute to the overall objectives of Creative Commons as long as they abide by CC policies and any additional Chapter policies and rules. If by whatever process is established by a Chapter for admission of a Member or other representative, there is disagreement about denying participation in a Chapter, the Chapter will refer the matter to the Global Network Council for resolution.

## What else can a local Chapter do?

As long as they are aligned with the set of documents established by the Global Network and don’t contradict the Creative Commons mission and vision, Chapters can establish the following:

* Specific rules for decision-making processes aligned with the CC mission and vision provided they do not discrimination or otherwise unjustifiable allow exclusion;
* Specific rules and process for participation of Members, and other contributors;
* Structures to coordinate activities within a country, particularly on questions of legal interpretation and government policy, aligned with applicable CC policies.

Chapters may develop and maintain an organizational structure that could include management and coordination, governance processes, designated spokespeople, or designated subject matter leads who speak on or coordinate activities on key issues. Chapters may also define limits and offer guidance to members on their team as to how they can operate and speak on behalf of CC in that country.

All these documents, rules and mechanisms **must be made public, accessible and easy to understand** for any person willing to join in the local chapter. Local chapters are entitled to keep key information in private (i.e., a strategy for copyright reform), but the basis for keeping information in private should be established.

Local chapters can establish their own communication mechanisms, but these **should be** clear and transparent and widely publicized to allow others to participate.

Being a Member, or other contributor means, in specific cases, to have a minimum amount of knowledge over intellectual property and Creative Commons licenses. In order to make sure that members are working from a knowledgeable base, Chapters can request new members to join in and follow a specific training course.

Members and other contributors to a Chapter may be expected to follow these training courses, and must agree to understand and accept the values, policies, and codes of conduct in order to establish common ground and an agreed-upon set of basic mutual expectations.
