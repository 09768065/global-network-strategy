# Membership Council (interim and permanent): How to approve new members of the Network

* As part of the Membership Council, you will be asked to approve or decline to approve the applications of vouched Members on the [Network webpage](http://network.creativecommons.org). This applies both to Institutional Members and Individual Members.
* The application must be approved by **5 members** of the Membership Council (interim and permanent) who agree that the person or organization meet the criteria established for membership. We have established an electronic procedure for this on the [CC Network page](http://network.creativecommons.org).
* Things to consider:
	* We will try to analyze the applications weekly, in a rolling basis.
	* Members of the Membership Council who already vouched in favor of a Member may not participate in the approval process; that is, the person or organization applying needs to be confirmed by 5 *other* members.
	* You must also abide by the **Evaluation Criteria Applicable to Vouchers and the Membership Council**, set forth below. You will be asked to affirmatively state that you are acting consistent with those criteria.
	* Once a Member is approved, they will become part of the Creative Commons Global Network and, as such, they will be able to vouch others following the rules for Vouching contained in this document.
	* In case the individual or organization fails to gather the approval of 5 members of the Membership Council, they will have the chance to apply again once the Global Network Committee (GNC) is first convened at the 2018 Global Summit.
	* Keep in mind that the overall policy of the vouching process is to give individuals and institutions *the benefit of the doubt*, trusting that they will abide by the Charter (and policies referenced therein). This is the “wide end of the funnel” into our network. We trust at face value that those seeking membership are genuine in their desire to work in support of the goals and mission of the network and Creative Commons. There are procedures for removing a member if it is determined that the member has violated the principles of the Charter, the Code of Conduct and Policies described therein and/or additional rules established by any Platform, Workgroup or Chapter.

By vouching for an applicant, you consent to Creative Commons sending your personal information to the members of the Membership Council, which has final decision making authority with respect to the application. See our [Privacy Policy](https://creativecommons.org/privacy/) for more information about how we are using your information.

Your decisions and actions in the course of vouching or refusing to vouch for an applicant should be based on the best interests of CC and the CCGN, and not based on personal relationships or benefits. Avoid situations where your personal activities and relationships conflict, or appear to conflict, with these interests, including situations where you may have or appear to have an indirect conflict through. We expect at a minimum that you avoid vouching or declining to vouch for an individual with which you have a significant personal relationship or to whom you are related, and in the case of institutional applications vouching or declining to vouch for an entity with which you have an employment or contractual relationship. These are minimum guidelines. We trust you to use your best judgment, but if you have questions feel free to contact network-support@creativecommons.org.

### Evaluation Criteria Applicable to Vouchers and the Membership Council

Creative Commons is an organization committed to the freedom and equality of individuals, no matter their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, age, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship, primary language, immigration status, or other protected category. Accordingly, **you may not** take any such factors, or any other factors prohibited by applicable law, in consideration when vouching for or refusing to vouch for an applicant. Similarly, Creative Commons encourages persons to speak up if they in good faith report violations of law. You may not take an applicant's whistleblower activity into consideration in vouching for or declining to vouch for an applicant.

Pursuant to the terms of the [Master Privacy Policy](https://creativecommons.org/privacy/) and Express Consent, the following personal information may be collected about you as a voucher or as a member of the Membership Council, including but not limited to:

* Name.
* Email address;
* Information on how you know the candidate;
* Country you have identified with or are located;
* URLs and links to social media; and
* Any other information that you elect to provide.

All personal information that was submitted and collected for the purpose of vouching or declining to vouch for an applicant will be deleted after 21 days from the time a decision is made by the Membership Council about the applicant (whether positive or negative), with the exception of actual vote of the voucher (only Boolean data is preserved, but none of the personal statements the voucher may have provided are).

If you have any questions or concerns about this process, we are happy to help you by email at network-support@creativecommons.org. Or you can always check the [updated documentation in our Github page](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy).
