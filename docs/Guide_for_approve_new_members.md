# Membership Committee: How to approve new members of the Network

## 4 first things to do:
 
1. Check the [applications pending of approving](https://network.creativecommons.org/wp-admin/users.php?page=global-network-application-approval).
2. **Read carefully each application under review**. Also, read carefully the vouching statements made by the vouchers of each application. There, you will find more information about the person applying and their connection with the Commons. 
3. In case the vouching statement is not clear enough to you, you can ask the voucher for clarification. To do that, just press the button "Ask for clarification" at the bottom of the voucher textbox.
4. Remember to be up-to-date with the [Charter of this Committee](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/charters/Charter_of_the_GNC_Membership_Committee.md).

---

* As part of the Membership Committee, you will be asked to approve or decline to approve the applications of vouched Members on the [Network webpage](http://network.creativecommons.org). This applies both to Institutional Members and Individual Members.
* The application must be approved by **5 members** of the Membership Committee who agree that the person or organization meet the criteria established for membership. We have established an electronic procedure for this on the [CC Network page](http://network.creativecommons.org).
* Things to consider:
	* We will try to analyze the applications weekly, in a rolling basis.
	* Members of the Membership Committee who already vouched in favor of a Member may not participate in the approval process; that is, the person or organization applying needs to be confirmed by 5 *other* members.
	* You must also abide by the **Evaluation Criteria Applicable to Vouchers and the Membership Committee**, set forth below. You will be asked to affirmatively state that you are acting consistent with those criteria.
	* Once a Member is approved, they will become part of the Creative Commons Global Network and, as such, they will be able to vouch others following the rules for Vouching contained in this document.
	* In case the individual or organization fails to gather the approval of 5 members of the Membership Committee, they will have the chance to apply again once the Global Network Committee (GNC) is first convened at the 2018 Global Summit.
	* Keep in mind that the overall policy of the vouching process is to give individuals and institutions *the benefit of the doubt*, trusting that they will abide by the Charter (and policies referenced therein). This is the “wide end of the funnel” into our network. We trust at face value that those seeking membership are genuine in their desire to work in support of the goals and mission of the network and Creative Commons. There are procedures for removing a member if it is determined that the member has violated [the principles of the Charter](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy/blob/master/charters/Charter_of_the_Global_Network_Council.md), the Code of Conduct and Policies described therein and/or additional rules established by any Platform, Workgroup or Chapter.

By vouching for an applicant, you consent to Creative Commons sending your personal information to the members of the Membership Committee, which has final decision making authority with respect to the application. See our [Privacy Policy](https://creativecommons.org/privacy/) for more information about how we are using your information.

Your decisions and actions in the course of vouching or refusing to vouch for an applicant should be based on the best interests of CC and the CCGN, and not based on personal relationships or benefits. Avoid situations where your personal activities and relationships conflict, or appear to conflict, with these interests, including situations where you may have or appear to have an indirect conflict through. We expect at a minimum that you avoid vouching or declining to vouch for an individual with which you have a significant personal relationship or to whom you are related, and in the case of institutional applications vouching or declining to vouch for an entity with which you have an employment or contractual relationship. These are minimum guidelines. We trust you to use your best judgment, but if you have questions feel free to contact network-support@creativecommons.org.

## How to approve new members

Once an application has been *formally vouched* (the Members mentioned as vouchers confirm their vouch online), members of the Interim Membership Committee should approve or reject the application based on this guide. When the application receives 5 votes from the Interim Membership Committee, the application is considered approved.

### Check the list of applications on approving stage
Go to the ["Global Network Application Approval" page](https://network.creativecommons.org/wp-admin/users.php?page=global-network-application-approval) in the WordPress Admin section of the site. There, you will see the list of current applications that are at the approving stage.

![Membership Application screen](/docs/approving_1.png)

Each application shows the type of application, its state, the number of Vouches and Votes for it, and the application date.

The username is the link to the Application details page. To Vote on the Application you must follow that link heading to the Application details.

We use 3 different colors, letting you know different information about the applications. With colors we identify whether you already voted for an application (green background), somebody asked the vocher for clarification (light orange background) or if the voucher already updated the information requested to be clarified (light blue background)

### Review Application Details and vote

![Application details screen](/docs/approving_2.png)

On the Application Details page is the information the Applicant entered when applying to become an Individual.

After reviewing this information, and following this Guide, you can vote for or against the Application using the buttons at the bottom of the page.

Make sure to follow the **Evaluation Criteria Applicable to Vouchers and the Membership Committee** below and to discuss any concerns with the rest of the Membership Committee before voting.

Once you have voted you cannot alter your vote, so double-check that you have chosen the correct option before submitting the form.

### Asking for clarification

If you are part of the Members Committee, you will be able to see, right below the statement wrote by each voucher, a button labeled 'Ask for clarification'. You should press this button in case you think the statement of support wrote by the voucher is not really clear or is not helpful for giving you a better sense about the application. 

Once you ask for that clarification, the application will be displayed in a different color on the "Applications for Approval" window, showing now a light yellow color, as in the image below.

## Evaluation Criteria Applicable to Vouchers and the Membership Committee

Creative Commons is an organization committed to the freedom and equality of individuals, no matter their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, age, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship, primary language, immigration status, or other protected category. Accordingly, **you may not** take any such factors, or any other factors prohibited by applicable law, in consideration when vouching for or refusing to vouch for an applicant. Similarly, Creative Commons encourages persons to speak up if they in good faith report violations of law. You may not take an applicant's whistleblower activity into consideration in vouching for or declining to vouch for an applicant.

Pursuant to the terms of the [Master Privacy Policy](https://creativecommons.org/privacy/) and Express Consent, the following personal information may be collected about you as a voucher or as a member of the Membership Committee, including but not limited to:

* Name.
* Email address;
* Information on how you know the candidate;
* Country you have identified with or are located;
* URLs and links to social media; and
* Any other information that you elect to provide.

All personal information that was submitted and collected for the purpose of vouching or declining to vouch for an applicant will be deleted after 21 days from the time a decision is made by the Membership Committee about the applicant (whether positive or negative), with the exception of actual vote of the voucher (only Boolean data is preserved, but none of the personal statements the voucher may have provided are).

If you have any questions or concerns about this process, we are happy to help you by email at network-support@creativecommons.org. Or you can always check the [updated documentation in our Github page](https://github.com/creativecommons/global-network-strategy).
