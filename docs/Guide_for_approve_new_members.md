# Interim Membership Council: How to approve new members of the Network

* As part of the Interim Membership Council, you will be asked to approve the applications of vouched Members on the [Network webpage](network.creativecommons.org). This applies both to Institutional Members and Individual Members.

* The application of both Members will be approved if **5 members** of the Interim Membership Council agree that the person or organization meet the criteria established for memberships. We have established an electronic procedure for this [on the CC Network page](network.creativecommons.org).

* Things to consider:

    * We will try to analyze the applications weekly, in a rolling basis.

    * Members of the Interim Membership Council who already vouched for a Member will not participate of the approval process; that is, the person or organization applying needs to be confirmed by 5 *other* members.

* Once a Member is approved, they will become part of the Creative Commons Global Network and, as such, they will be able to vouch others following the rules for Vouching.

* In case the person or organization fails to gather the approval of 5 members of the Interim Membership Council, they will have the chance to apply again once the Global Network Committee (GNC) is first convened at the 2018 Global Summit.

* Keep in mind that the overall policy of the vouching process is to give individuals and institutions *the benefit of the doubt*, trusting that they will abide by the Charter (and policies referenced therein). This is the "wide end of the funnel" into our network. We trust at face value that those seeking membership are genuine in their desire to work in support of the goals and mission of the network and Creative Commons. There are procedures for removing a member if it is determined that the member has violated the principles of the Charter, the Code of Conduct and Policies described therein and/or additional rules established by any Platform, Workgroup or Chapter.
